Tasks:
write answers to questions in aiml
	- directions and information for locations started
	- I made it easy to add more locations later
	- add variety random responses
	- add errors in some messages


Give fallthrough responses a 'patience' level
	- every time a fall-through response is used increased by n
	- when n gets too high, stop responding to unknown messages
	- this will only be an issue if we don't give appropriate responses for all possible univeristy questions
	- so as long as our coding is correct this will make her look more human
