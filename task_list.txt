Tasks:

fix bots aiml file load in
	- possibly solved (?)


finish list of possible questions


write answers to questions in aiml
	- directions and information for locations started
	- I made it easy to add more locations later


link with fb api


add variety random responses


add multiple response sequences, with some errors in the responses
	- errors will make her look more human but I think we should give her very few errors because she is meant to be official; general typos will do


give Steph a fall-through response when she doesn't understand the input
	- also include a 'patience' level
	- every time a fall-through response is used increased by n
	- when n gets too high, stop responding to unknown messages
	- this will only be an issue if we don't give appropriate responses for all possible univeristy questions
	- so as long as our coding is correct this will make her look more human
